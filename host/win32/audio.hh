// The host audio engine as the Win32 shims see it (docs/AUDIO.md §7).
//
// One adw::audio::Engine per process: the lane hands it over with
// attach_audio() (LaneContext::audio, or audio::null_engine() when the host
// runs without one), and the DSOUND (dsound.cc), WINMM (winmm.cc) and
// MSACM32 (msacm32.cc) shims reach it through audio_engine(). Until a lane
// attaches one, and whenever the engine is disabled (no ADSOUND=1, no
// ADAUDIOOUT), every shim answers exactly as the silent host always did:
// dsound.dll is not found, MCI and aux have no devices, ACM has no driver and
// waveOut has no device (§7.1). Nothing but config()/enabled() is called on a
// disabled engine.
//
// Time: every audio call passes the engine audio_now(), the virtual clock
// peeked (rt.clock().now_us()); an audio call never moves the clock and never
// passes a time later than now (the engine takes the latest time it has seen
// as "now" for ever after).
