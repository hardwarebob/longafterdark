// How a saver window puts the host's frames on its monitor (scr/README.md,
// "Scaling"): the frame is letterboxed into the window (black bars) and
// scaled, by the GPU through Direct2D where it can be, else by GDI's
// StretchDIBits.
//
// GDI's good filter (HALFTONE) upscales in software: about 27 ms a paint for
// 856x480 -> 3840x2160, so on a 4K monitor the saver used to drop to
// nearest-neighbour COLORONCOLOR to keep up. Direct2D uploads the frame (an
// 8-bit frame through its palette) as a 32-bit bitmap and scales it on the
// GPU the way HALFTONE scales an upscale (crisp, evenly sized pixels, blended
// only where two meet), for under 2 ms a frame at 4K. GDI stays the
// fallback: for a window whose render target can't be made or keeps
// failing, and for /p.
